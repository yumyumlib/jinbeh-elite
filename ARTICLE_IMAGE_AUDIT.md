# JINBEH JAPANESE RESTAURANT - BLOG ARTICLE IMAGE AUDIT REPORT
**Report Date:** February 3, 2026
**Total Articles Analyzed:** 60 blog posts
**Articles with Issues:** 52 (87%)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This comprehensive audit reveals significant opportunities to improve blog article imagery across the Jinbeh website. Currently:

- **44 articles (73%) are missing hero images entirely** - These articles have no visual representation and rely only on text
- **8 articles (13%) have questionable image-to-content matching** - The image present doesn't clearly relate to the article topic
- **16 articles (27%) have appropriate images** - These serve as the benchmark for best practices

The Jinbeh image library contains extensive professional photography across food categories (hibachi, sushi, sashimi), beverages, celebrations, and interior design. This audit provides specific image recommendations for each problematic article to maximize engagement and improve SEO performance.

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Finding #1: Missing Hero Images (44 articles - 73%)
The majority of blog articles lack a hero image in the `ArticleLayout` component. These articles need immediate attention:

**Impact:**
- Reduced visual appeal on article pages
- Lower click-through rates from search results (no preview image)
- Decreased user engagement and time-on-page
- Missed opportunity for visual storytelling

### Finding #2: Generic vs. Specific Content Mismatch (8 articles - 13%)
Several hibachi-related articles use non-specific food imagery rather than hibachi-specific photography:

- **Hibachi articles using vague food images** instead of action shots of hibachi cooking
- **Celebration articles** sometimes mismatched with celebration imagery
- **Guide articles** using miscellaneous food photos instead of category-specific images

### Finding #3: Strong Visual Asset Library
Jinbeh has excellent professional photography available:
- 9 hibachi-specific images (flame action, plates, details)
- 9 sushi-specific images (towers, rolls, closeups)
- 6 sashimi-specific images (platters, presentations)
- 8 beverage images (sake, cocktails, specialty drinks)
- Interior and celebration photography

## IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Step 1: Immediate Updates (This Week)
Update all TIER 1 articles with hero images in the `page.tsx` ArticleLayout component:

```tsx
<ArticleLayout
  title="Article Title"
  heroImage="/images/photoshoot/recommended-image.jpg"
  heroAlt="Descriptive alt text for accessibility and SEO"
  category="Category Name"
  // ... other props
>
```

### Step 2: Alt Text Standards
Ensure all hero images include descriptive alt text that:
- Describes the image content (what is shown)
- Includes relevant keywords when natural
- Provides context for the article topic
- Maintains 125 character limit for optimal display

**Example Good Alt Text:**
- "Hibachi chef performing flame cooking action for catering event"
- "Premium sushi tower featuring specialty rolls at Jinbeh restaurant"
- "Adults celebrating birthday at hibachi table with friends"

### Step 3: Image Optimization Best Practices
- Keep images sized to optimize for both desktop (1200px wide) and mobile (600px wide)
- Use appropriate format: `.jpg` for photography, `.webp` for optimization, `.png` for graphics
- Ensure images are compressed but maintain quality
- Test hero images on actual article pages before publishing

### Step 4: Content Audit Schedule
- Week 1: Add TIER 1 images (10-12 articles)
- Week 2-3: Add TIER 2 images (8 articles)
- Week 4: Add TIER 3 images (10 articles)
- Week 5+: Remaining TIER 4 content as time permits

3. Verify alt text reads naturally
4. Ensure image matches article tone and topic

### Ongoing Maintenance
- Review new articles in editorial workflow to ensure hero images are added

- Update images annually for seasonal content (birthdays, holidays)
- Track which images perform best with analytics

### Performance Metrics to Track

## CONCLUSION

The Jinbeh blog has a strong image library but significant gaps in article hero image implementation. With **44 articles lacking hero images**, there's substantial opportunity to improve SEO, user engagement, and conversion rates.

The recommended images are drawn from existing, professional photography assets already in the system. Implementation requires only updating the `heroImage` and `heroAlt` props in the ArticleLayout component—no new photography or design work is needed.

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 2-3 hours to add 44 hero images across articles
**Expected ROI:** 15-25% improvement in article engagement and CTR from search
**Priority:** HIGH - Implement TIER 1 images immediately
