                                        Start with sashimi or sushi to experience the fish at its purest. Try signature rolls that showcase
                                        the chef's style, then explore cooked options like grilled fish or hibachi if desired. Don't miss

                                        Make reservations, especially for larger groups. Ask your server for recommendations and don't
                                        hesitate to ask about the freshness of specific items. Most seafood restaurants are happy to explain
